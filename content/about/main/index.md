  I'm thinking a lot about strategies! Strategies for scaling company-wide knowledge sharing, and fostering a healthy culture for both writers and readers. Strategies for how to grow products from 0 to 1. Strategies for supporting open-source products as an entry point to enterprise products in an authentic way, not as the "freemium" version with bad docs. Strategies for getting a community of users to rally behind what you build. And strategies for sharing and developing strategies ðŸ˜„
