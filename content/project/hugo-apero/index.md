The Mauritius or ‘echo’ parakeet (Alexandrinus eques) is perhaps the most acutely studied bird in Mauritius and maybe one of the most studied in the world. Due to human settlement and expansion since the 17th century, which led to habitat loss and fragmentation (Cheke and Hume, 2020; Safford, 1997; Vaughan and Wiehe, 1937), as well as the introduction of exotic plants and animals (Lorence and Sussman, 1986), the population size and range of echo parakeets began to decline. By the 1980s, this decline had progressed to the point where the species was classified as 'critically endangered' on the IUCN Red List. The extinction of the species
seemed imminent by the early 1990s, when the echo parakeet was considered not only the rarest parrot in the world (Venning, 1993), but also one of the world's rarest and most endangered bird of 
any group (Collar et al., 1994). However, intensive conservation efforts helped the species to recover from a population size of fewer than 20 individuals in the 1980s (Jones 1987, Jones and Duffy 1993) to over 150 breeding pairs and 800 individuals in 2020 (MWF, 2020). As a result, the species was downlisted on the IUCN Red List twice this century, from Critically Endangered to Endangered in 2007
(BirdLife International, 2007), and to Vulnerable in 2019 (BirdLife International, 2019).

## Why apéro?

Apéro is a unique kind of casual get-together in French culture, when you gather with friends and get to know each other better over some apéritifs, snacks, and anything in between. A good apéro is one where you'd happily spend a few hours just hanging out.

I hope this theme helps you create your own virtual apéro. A place where you and your site's visitors enjoy spending time, and one that helps folks get to know you better.
